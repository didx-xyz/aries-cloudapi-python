🚧 This project is currently under development. If you would like to use this in
production, please [contact us](mailto:info@didx.co.za) first to discuss your use case.

✅ You should be able to deploy this project in a local environment using the
[Quick Start Guide](./docs/src/Quick%20Start%20Guide.md)

## Overview

This project comprises a [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) application built
around [ACA-Py](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/acapy),
primarily tailored for [Yoma](https://yoma.world)-specific use cases.

The main [app](app) provides an API interface
that simplifies complex self-sovereign identity (SSI) workflows. Using our
[ACA-Py controller](https://github.com/didx-xyz/aries-cloudcontroller-python), it
provides a streamlined layer of abstraction for client applications (e.g., a
mobile app) to interact within an SSI ecosystem.

What would normally require multiple calls to ACA-Py can be condensed into a single call
through this API. For example, onboarding an issuer — which involves creating a wallet,
establishing a connection with an endorser, generating a public DID, accepting the
Transaction Author Agreement (TAA), publishing the DID to the ledger, and awaiting
confirmation — can all be achieved with a single API call. Convenient, isn't it?

We simplify several key capabilities, including:

- Creating and managing wallets
- Onboarding issuers and verifiers
- Managing connections between parties
- Creating schemas and credential definitions
- Issuing verifiable credentials and handling revocations
- Requesting and validating proofs

To enable this, the project includes essential supporting services:

- An [Endorser](endorser) agent and service for authorizing ledger transactions
- A [Trust Registry](trustregistry) implementation for authorizing valid issuers, verifiers,
  and approved credential schemas
- A webhooks service ([Waypoint](waypoint)) for real-time, server-sent event
  (SSE) notifications and updates

## How to Run It

> [!NOTE]
> For local development we now use Tilt and Kind instead of Docker Compose.
> Legacy Docker Compose files are still available, but deprecated and will be
> removed in the future.

Running the project is straightforward — it's all containerized. Simply execute
`mise run tilt:up` from the project root. This command will spin up a Kind
cluster, build all the necessary docker images, and start the project.
You can then visit [localhost:10350](http://localhost:10350) to access the Tilt
UI.

For detailed setup instructions and requirements, see the [Quick Start Guide](docs/src/Quick%20Start%20Guide.md).

## Running Tests

The tests use `pytest`. For convenience, use Mise to run them. First, ensure
the project is running locally by executing `mise run tilt:up`. In another shell,
you can now run `mise run tests` to run all tests or `mise run tests:unit` to run
only the unit tests.

```bash
mise run tilt:up
```

Install the requirements:

```bash
mise run poetry:install
```

To run the tests you need to set up some environment variables to point Pytest
at the correct endpoints.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
source .env
```

Then you can run the tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest .
```

Or only the unit tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest --ignore=app/tests/e2e
```

You can specify the log level of the pytest output by using the `--log-cli-level`
flag.

```bash
poetry run pytest . --log-cli-level=DEBUG
```

This will output all log messages with a log level of `DEBUG` or higher.

To run specific tests, you can specify the path to the test file and the test
method. For example:

```bash
poetry run pytest \
  app/tests/e2e/test_verifier_oob.py::test_accept_proof_request_oob \
  --log-cli-level=1
```

## Running containerised tests

```bash
mise run tilt:up
```

In another terminal:

```bash
# Run e2e tests
helm upgrade --install acapy-test \
  -f ./helm/acapy-test/conf/local/values.yaml \
  ./helm/acapy-test

# Bootstrap regression tests
helm upgrade --install acapy-regression-test \
  -f ./helm/acapy-test/conf/local/values.yaml \
  -f ./helm/acapy-test/conf/local/regression.yaml \
  --set env.FAIL_ON_RECREATING_FIXTURES=false \
  ./helm/acapy-test

# Run regression tests
helm upgrade --install acapy-regression-test \
  -f ./helm/acapy-test/conf/local/values.yaml \
  -f ./helm/acapy-test/conf/local/regression.yaml \
  --set env.FAIL_ON_RECREATING_FIXTURES=true \
  ./helm/acapy-test
```

> [!NOTE]
> At the time of writing, if you are running tests on an ARM based machine, it is
> expected that `bbs` tests will fail as `bbs` is not currently supported on ARM.
