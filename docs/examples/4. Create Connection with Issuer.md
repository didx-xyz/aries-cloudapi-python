# 4: Create Connection

Now that the Issuer has a credential definition, they can start issuing
credentials. However, in order to do that, they first needs to create a
connection to the holder. There are multiple ways to create connections. We will
use the `/v1/connections/` endpoints in these examples.

## Create connection between Holder and Issuer

`POST /v1/connections/did-exchange/create-request`

This endpoint allows a tenant to send a request to another tenant with a public
DID to create a connection. Tenants on the platform are configured to auto-accept
connections; therefore, connections will proceed to completion automatically.

The following parameters are available on the endpoint:

- `their_public_did` The DID of the party you want to connect to.
- `alias` An alias for the connection. Defaults to None.
- `goal` Optional self-attested string for sharing the intent of the connection.
- `goal_code` Similar to goal
- `my_label` Will be the wallet label, can be overwritten.
- `use_did` Your local DID to use for the connection.
- `use_did_method` The method to use for the connection: "did:peer:2" or "did:peer:4".
- `use_public_did` Use your public DID for this connection. Defaults to False.

>Note: Only one of `use_did`, `use_did_method` or `use_public_did` should be specified.
If none of these are specified, a new local DID will be created for this
connection.

As the `Holder` we create a connection with the `Issuer`, using the did-exchange
protocol.

```bash
curl 'http://cloudapi.127.0.0.1.nip.io/tenant/v1/connections/did-exchange/create-request?their_public_did=did%3Asov%3AVvWbYuE8GAkxCgKp6FnPWK&alias=Alice-Faber' \
  --request POST \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: tenant.<Holder token>'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "alias": "Alice-Faber",
  "connection_id": "165148b3-7e3b-4dec-9568-69694a2ba67f",

  "their_role": "inviter",
  "updated_at": "2025-01-14T09:31:52.724460Z"
}
```

Both of the tenants can listen to `SSE events` to track the progress of
the connection being made. Once the `state` is `completed`, the connection is
made. This can also be asserted by fetching connection records for the holder or
issuer, and validating that their connection has transitioned to state:
completed.

Below is an example of a webhook event indicating the `completed` state.

> the `Issuer` will be different from that of the `Holder`, even though they refer
