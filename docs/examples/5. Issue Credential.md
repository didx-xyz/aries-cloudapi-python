# 5: Issuing a Credential

## Now the Issuer issues credentials

Now that a connection has been made between the `Issuer` and the `Holder`, the `Issuer` can send the credential to the
`Holder` using the `connection_id` from the `Issuer's` perspective.

> Again both tenants can listen for events on the topic: `credentials`

### Issuing a Non-Revocable Credential

To issue a non-revocable credential, the issuer needs to send a POST request to the appropriate endpoint.
Below is an example of how to issue a non-revocable credential:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8300/v1/issuer/credentials' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: tenant.<Issuer token>' \
  -d '{
  "type": "indy",
  "indy_credential_detail": {
    "credential_definition_id": "QrHj82kaE61jnB5451zvvG:3:CL:12:Demo Person",
    "attributes": {
      "Name": "Alice",
      "Surname": "Holder",
      "Age": "25"
    }
  },
  "connection_id": "c78f9423-370e-4800-a48e-962456083943",
  "protocol_version": "v2"
}'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "attributes": {
    "Name": "Alice",
    "Surname": "Holder",
    "Age": "25"
  },
  "connection_id": "c78f9423-370e-4800-a48e-962456083943",
  "created_at": "2023-11-20T09:59:29.820002Z",
  "credential_definition_id": "QrHj82kaE61jnB5451zvvG:3:CL:12:Demo Person",
  "credential_exchange_id": "v2-f126edb7-1ac1-43a3-bf1f-60b8feae4701",
  "did": null,
  "error_msg": null,
  "protocol_version": "v2",
  "role": "issuer",
  "schema_id": "FS9J6WZ6KVxwy5eGH32CgM:2:Person:0.1.0",
  "state": "offer-sent",
  "thread_id": "9ceeb941-4ebd-42ec-9ffc-ea0b7fe39722",
  "type": "indy",
  "updated_at": "2023-11-20T09:59:29.820002Z"
}
```

As you can see from the state, an offer has now been sent, and needs to be accepted/requested by the holder.

> Note that the issuer will now have what's called a _credential exchange record_ in state: offer-sent.
> _Pending_ exchange records can be viewed by calling `GET /v1/issuer/credentials`, and _completed_
> credential exchange records are deleted by default, but can be preserved by adding an optional
> `save_exchange_record=True` field to the request.

### Issuing a Revocable Credential

Credentials that support revocation are issued in the same way as described above, but there is additional information
that the issuer needs to keep track of.

There is a webhook event topic that an issuer can subscribe to called `"issuer_cred_rev"`. The `"issuer_cred_rev"`
event has information on the issued credential and how it is connected to the revocation registries and some metadata.

This event will fire under two circumstances:

- Once a credential (with revocation support) is issued.
- And when a credential is revoked.

The state of the event will correspond with these events, i.e. first it will be **"issued"** and after revocation it
will be **"revoked"**.

Let's take a look at an example event:

```json
{
  "wallet_id": "5df42bab-6719-4c8a-a615-8086435d4de4",
  "topic": "issuer_cred_rev",
  "origin": "tenant faber",
  "group_id": "GroupA",
  "payload": {
    "created_at": "2024-04-30T08:51:18.177543Z",
    "cred_def_id": "QrMaE11MnC6zjKNY1pxbq8:3:CL:8:Epic",
    "cred_ex_id": "af4bad3f-3fcc-47ab-85e6-24224dcb2779",
    "cred_ex_version": "2",
    "cred_rev_id": "2",
    "record_id": "57bd9c72-fa29-4f65-bd89-4e241471073a",
    "rev_reg_id": "QrMaE11MnC6zjKNY1pxbq8:4:QrMaE11MnC6zjKNY1pxbq8:3:CL:8:Epic:CL_ACCUM:53462552-d716-4b0b-8b5c-914a3574d2c4",
    "state": "issued",
    "updated_at": "2024-04-30T08:51:18.177543Z"
  }
}
```

Taking a look at the payload, there are a few fields we are interested in:

- `"cred_def_id"` or **credential definition id**: The same id the issuer gets when creating a credential definition
  (also used when issuing credentials).
- `"cred_ex_id"` or **credential exchange id**: This is the same exchange id that can be found in the credential
  exchange record, the protocol version is just stripped here.
- `"cred_rev_id"` or **credential revocation id**: This is the id that ties the credential to the revocation registry.
- `"rev_reg_id"` or **revocation registry id**: This is the id of the revocation registry the credential was
  issued against.

The `"issuer_cred_rev"` event is not the only place this data is available. Under the issuer API,
there is an endpoint: `GET /v1/issuer/credentials/revocation/record`.
This endpoint will return the payload object of the `"issuer_cred_rev"` event:

```json
{
  "created_at": "2024-04-30T08:51:18.177543Z",
  "cred_def_id": "QrMaE11MnC6zjKNY1pxbq8:3:CL:8:Epic",
  "cred_ex_id": "af4bad3f-3fcc-47ab-85e6-24224dcb2779",
  "cred_ex_version": "2",
  "cred_rev_id": "2",
  "record_id": "57bd9c72-fa29-4f65-bd89-4e241471073a",
  "rev_reg_id": "QrMaE11MnC6zjKNY1pxbq8:4:QrMaE11MnC6zjKNY1pxbq8:3:CL:8:Epic:CL_ACCUM:53462552-d716-4b0b-8b5c-914a3574d2c4",
  "state": "issued",
  "updated_at": "2024-04-30T08:51:18.177543Z"
}
```

This endpoint has three query parameters:

- `"credential_exchange_id"`
- `"credential_revocation_id"`
- `"revocation_registry_id"`

If `"credential_exchange_id"` is not provided, both the `"credential_revocation_id"` and `"revocation_registry_id"`
must be provided.

So with the `"credential_exchange_id"` (from the credential exchange record), an issuer can get the relevant data
needed to revoke the credential associated with the exchange id.

> [!NOTE] Issuers take note:
> The _most_ important thing the issuer needs to keep track of is how their credential exchange ids map to
> credentials they have issued to holders. Without knowing how their exchange ids map to their holders,
> they won't know which credential to revoke.

## Holder requests credential

Now the `Holder` needs to respond to the credential sent to them. Below the `Holder` is getting all their connections.
We are doing this to get the `connection_id` of the connection to the issuer.
This `connection_id` can also be gotten from the `SSE events`.

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://localhost:8300/v1/connections' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: tenant.<Holder token>'
```

Response:

```json
[
  {
    "alias": "Holder <> Issuer",
    "connection_id": "ac3b0d56-eb33-408a-baeb-0370164d47ae",
    "connection_protocol": "connections/1.0",
    "created_at": "2023-11-20T09:56:41.437966Z",
    "error_msg": null,
    "invitation_key": "91ZNSpDgVoV12kHcmUqyp1JmGeKE7oGi9NFd2WMzKt4X",
    "invitation_mode": "once",
    "invitation_msg_id": "6a86e6c7-af25-4e5d-87fe-b42f559b13b9",
    "my_did": "MYhLew4uq58mou8SCTNFYp",
    "state": "completed",
    "their_did": "6wMwbinRJ5XKyBJKm7P5av",
    "their_label": "Demo Issuer",
    "their_public_did": null,
    "their_role": "inviter",
    "updated_at": "2023-11-20T09:56:41.656141Z"
  }
]
```

Note the `connection_id` in the above response.

The `Holder` can then find the credentials offered to them on this `connection_id` by calling `/v1/issuer/credentials`
with the optional `connection_id` query parameter:

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://localhost:8300/v1/issuer/credentials?connection_id=ac3b0d56-eb33-408a-baeb-0370164d47ae' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: tenant.<Holder token>'
```

Response:

```json
[
  {
    "attributes": {
      "Name": "Alice",
      "Surname": "Holder",
      "Age": "25"
    },
    "connection_id": "ac3b0d56-eb33-408a-baeb-0370164d47ae",
    "created_at": "2023-11-20T09:59:29.868946Z",
    "credential_definition_id": "QrHj82kaE61jnB5451zvvG:3:CL:12:Demo Person",
    "credential_exchange_id": "v2-c492cec7-2f2d-4d5f-b839-b57dcd8f8eee",
    "did": null,
    "error_msg": null,
    "protocol_version": "v2",
    "role": "holder",
    "schema_id": "FS9J6WZ6KVxwy5eGH32CgM:2:Person:0.1.0",
    "state": "offer-received",
    "thread_id": "9ceeb941-4ebd-42ec-9ffc-ea0b7fe39722",
    "type": "indy",
    "updated_at": "2023-11-20T09:59:29.868946Z"
  }
]
```

Note the `credential_exchange_id` and `state: offer-received`. Additionally, note that the holder and the issuer have
different `credential_exchange_id` references for the same credential exchange interaction.

The `Holder` can now request the credential, using the `credential_exchange_id` from the above response,
by calling `/v1/issuer/credentials/{credential_exchange_id}/request`:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8300/v1/issuer/credentials/v2-c492cec7-2f2d-4d5f-b839-b57dcd8f8eee/request' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: tenant.<Holder token>' \
  -d ''
```

Response:

```json
{
  "attributes": {
    "Name": "Alice",
    "Surname": "Holder",
    "Age": "25"
  },
  "connection_id": "ac3b0d56-eb33-408a-baeb-0370164d47ae",
  "created_at": "2023-11-20T09:59:29.868946Z",
  "credential_definition_id": "QrHj82kaE61jnB5451zvvG:3:CL:12:Demo Person",
  "credential_exchange_id": "v2-c492cec7-2f2d-4d5f-b839-b57dcd8f8eee",
  "did": null,
  "error_msg": null,
  "protocol_version": "v2",
  "role": "holder",
  "schema_id": "FS9J6WZ6KVxwy5eGH32CgM:2:Person:0.1.0",
  "state": "request-sent",
  "thread_id": "9ceeb941-4ebd-42ec-9ffc-ea0b7fe39722",
  "type": "indy",
  "updated_at": "2023-11-20T10:02:02.708045Z"
}
```

The holder request has been sent, and an automated workflow will transition the credential to
being stored in the holder's wallet.

We can listen on SSE and wait for `state` to be `done` on the `topic`: `credentials`

```json
{
  "wallet_id": "7bb24cc8-2e56-4326-9020-7870ad67b257",
  "topic": "credentials",
  "origin": "multitenant",
  "payload": {
    "attributes": null,
    "connection_id": "ac3b0d56-eb33-408a-baeb-0370164d47ae",
    "created_at": "2023-11-20T09:59:29.868946Z",
    "credential_definition_id": "QrHj82kaE61jnB5451zvvG:3:CL:12:Demo Person",
    "credential_exchange_id": "v2-c492cec7-2f2d-4d5f-b839-b57dcd8f8eee",
    "did": null,
    "error_msg": null,
    "protocol_version": "v2",
    "role": "holder",
    "schema_id": "FS9J6WZ6KVxwy5eGH32CgM:2:Person:0.1.0",
    "state": "done",
    "thread_id": "9ceeb941-4ebd-42ec-9ffc-ea0b7fe39722",
    "type": "indy",
    "updated_at": "2023-11-20T10:02:03.043100Z"
  }
}
```

Once the state is done, the credential will be in the `Holder`'s wallet. We can list the credential in
the wallet by doing the following call as the `Holder`:

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://localhost:8300/v1/wallet/credentials' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: tenant.<Holder token>'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "attrs": {
        "Surname": "Holder",
        "Name": "Alice",
        "Age": "25"
      },
      "cred_def_id": "QrHj82kaE61jnB5451zvvG:3:CL:12:Demo Person",
      "cred_rev_id": null,
      "referent": "86dfb6ef-1ff5-41fd-977b-092a1d97e20b",
      "rev_reg_id": null,
      "schema_id": "FS9J6WZ6KVxwy5eGH32CgM:2:Person:0.1.0"
    }
  ]
}
```

> Note: the credential has no reference to a `credential_exchange_id`. In the wallet context, the `referent`
> is the credential id, and is different from the `credential_exchange_id` used during the credential exchange.

Hooray! 🥳🎉 The holder now has a credential!
