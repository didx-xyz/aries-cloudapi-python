      summary: Create a Connection Invitation
      description: "Create connection invitation\n---\nThis endpoint creates an invitation\
        \ object for establishing a connection with another tenant.\n\nFor every invitation\
        \ that is created, there will be a corresponding connection record with a\
        \ state\n`invitation-sent`. Once this invitation is accepted, the connection\
        \ record will transition to a state `completed`.\n\nIf `multi_use` is set\
        \ to true, the invitation can be re-used and accepted by multiple tenants.\n\
        \nCreating a multi-use invitation will create a connection record with `invitation_mode:\
        \ \"multi\"`\n(instead of `\"once\"`), and this connection record will remain\
        \ in a state `invitation-sent`, until it is deleted.\nEvery time a multi-use\
        \ invitation is accepted, a new connection record will be created with state\
        \ `completed`.\n\nThe `use_public_did` parameter determines whether to create\
        \ an invitation using your public DID.\nThis of course requires that you have\
        \ a public DID in your wallet, which by default is only true for issuers.\n\
        If `use_public_did` is set to False (default behaviour), then a random DID\
        \ will be generated for this invite.\n\nRequest Body:\n---\n    body: CreateInvitation\n\
        \        alias: str (Optional)\n            An alias for the connection invitation,\
        \ which will appear as the alias in the connection record.\n        multi_use:\
        \ bool (default: False)\n            Whether the invitation can be used multiple\
        \ times.\n        use_public_did: bool (default: False)\n            Whether\
        \ to use a public did for the invitation.\n\nReturns:\n---\n    InvitationResult\n\
        \        Contains an invitation object, an invitation url, and a connection\
        \ id for this invite."

        \ Signing:** Provide the `did` field with a valid DID.\nThe Aries agent will\
        \ automatically select the appropriate verification key associated with the\
        \ DID.\n\n- **Verification Method-Based Signing:** Provide the `verification_method`\
        \ field with a specific verification method\n(DID with verkey) to explicitly\
        \ specify which key to use for signing.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- If the issuer uses\
        \ a `did:sov` DID, ensure that the DID is public.\n- The `headers` field is\
        \ optional. Custom headers can be specified, but the `typ`, `alg`,\n  and\
        \ `kid` fields are automatically populated by the Aries agent based on the\

        \n- To exclude list elements:\n    - Use the format `\"<attribute_name>[start:end]\"\
        ` where `start` and `end` define the range\n      (e.g., `\"nationalities[1:3]\"\
        `).\n- To exclude specific dictionary attributes:\n    - Use the format `\"\
        <dictionary_name>.<attribute_name>\"` (e.g., `\"address.street_address\"`).\n\
